/*
 * Exception Handling - in Java is one of the effective means to handle the runtime errors 
 * so that the regular flow of the application can be preserved.
 * 
 * 
 * Exception - is an unwanted or unexpected event, which occurs during the execution of a program, 
 * i.e. at run time, that disrupts the normal flow of the program’s instructions. 
 * Exceptions can be caught and handled by the program.
 * 
 * Errors - represent irrecoverable conditions such as Java virtual machine (JVM) running out of memory, 
 * memory leaks, stack overflow errors, library incompatibility, infinite recursion, etc. 
 * Errors are usually beyond the control of the programmer, and we should not try to handle errors.
 * 
 * 
 * Exceptions Types:
 * 1. Built-in Exceptions
 * 		a. Checked Exception - compile-time exceptions
 * 		b. Unchecked Exception - run-time exceptions (if a program throws an unchecked exception, and even if we didn’t handle or declare it, the program would not give a compilation error)
 * 2. User-Defined Exceptions
 *
